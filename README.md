# SQL Aggregation and Window Functions Tasks
Overview
This document outlines a series of SQL tasks designed to practice and understand key concepts related to aggregation and window functions. The tasks use a hypothetical student_score table, which includes columns for student IDs, names, department names, and scores. The primary focus is on utilizing SQL features such as aggregate functions, GROUP BY, HAVING, WHERE, subqueries, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and especially window functions to perform various data analysis operations.

Key Concepts Covered
1. Basic Aggregation with GROUP BY
This task demonstrates how to calculate aggregate metrics, such as average scores, by grouping data based on specific columns. It highlights the use of the GROUP BY clause to aggregate results according to different categories.

2. Filtering Groups with HAVING
The HAVING clause is used to filter aggregated results based on certain conditions. This task focuses on applying HAVING to restrict results to those meeting specific criteria, such as departments with an average score above a threshold.

3. Using WHERE with Aggregation
This task involves comparing individual records against aggregated values using subqueries. It showcases how to filter rows based on conditions derived from aggregated data.

4. Using Subqueries to Filter with Aggregate Functions
Subqueries are employed to perform comparisons and filtering based on aggregated results. This task demonstrates how to use subqueries to identify specific departments or records meeting certain aggregated conditions.

5. Using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for Aggregation
CTEs are used to simplify complex queries by breaking them into manageable parts. This task illustrates how to use CTEs to calculate aggregate metrics, such as total student counts and average scores, and how to retrieve results from these intermediate calculations.

6. Introduction to Window Functions
Window functions are employed to perform calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row. This task focuses on using window functions to compute metrics such as moving averages, running totals, and ranking within partitions.

7. Calculating Moving Averages
This task demonstrates how to calculate moving averages for scores within each department using window functions. It illustrates the use of ROWS BETWEEN to define the window frame for moving calculations.

8. Computing Running Totals
This task involves calculating running totals using window functions to accumulate scores over time or by department. It emphasizes the use of window functions to maintain a cumulative total across rows.

9. Rank and NTILE Functions
This task covers the use of ranking functions such as RANK() and NTILE() to assign ranks or divide data into specified groups. It helps in understanding how to segment and rank data within partitions.

10. Combining Aggregation and Window Functions
This task shows how to combine aggregate functions with window functions to provide more advanced data analysis. It focuses on performing tasks like comparing individual scores against average scores within their department and calculating the difference from the departmentâ€™s average.

Summary
The tasks provided cover a range of SQL functionalities with a specific focus on window functions. They emphasize:

Aggregating data using GROUP BY
Filtering results with HAVING
Comparing and filtering data with WHERE and subqueries
Utilizing CTEs for simplifying and structuring complex queries
Applying window functions for advanced calculations such as moving averages, running totals, and ranking
These exercises are designed to enhance skills in SQL data manipulation and analysis, particularly with window functions, offering practical experience with both fundamental and advanced SQL techniques.
